optim_noise s212857 simpleWarning: The largest R-hat is 1.05, indicating chains have not mixed.
Running the chains for more iterations may help. See

optim_noise s212857 simpleWarning: Bulk Effective Samples Size (ESS) is too low, indicating posterior means and medians may be unreliable.
Running the chains for more iterations may help. See
